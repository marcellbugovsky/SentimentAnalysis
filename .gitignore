# Ignore potentially large data files or downloaded models stored locally.
# Add specific directories or file patterns if you store large data/models within the project.
# Note: Hugging Face models are typically cached globally (~/.cache/huggingface) and won't be committed,
# but if you save models *inside* the project structure, list those directories here.
# Example:
# models_cache/
# large_dataset.csv
